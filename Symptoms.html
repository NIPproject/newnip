            <h1>Symptoms of ADHD</h1>
            <p>ADHD symptoms can vary from person to person, but they typically fall into three categories: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</p>
            <h2>Inattention Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty sustaining focus during tasks or activities</li>
                <li>Difficulty following instructions or completing tasks</li>
                <li>Struggling to stay organized and manage time effectively</li>
                <li>Avoiding tasks that require mental effort</li>
                <li>Losing things frequently, such as pencils, phones, or wallets</li>
                <li>Forgetfulness, such as forgetting appointments or tasks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Inattention symptoms can manifest in different ways, such as difficulty paying attention to details, making careless mistakes, or having trouble staying organized. For example, a person with ADHD may have trouble completing homework assignments or may frequently forget to turn in assignments.</p>
            <p>In addition, people with ADHD may have trouble with self-monitoring, which means they may not be aware of their own mistakes or may not be able to correct them. This can lead to difficulties in academic and professional settings.</p>

            <h2>Hyperactivity Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fidgeting with hands or feet, or restlessness</li>
                <li>Leaving one's seat when it's not appropriate, such as in a classroom or meeting</li>
                <li>Feeling constantly "on the go" or having trouble engaging in quiet leisure activities</li>
                <li>Talking excessively or interrupting others</li>
                <li>Difficulty engaging in activities quietly, such as reading or doing puzzles</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/tap.jpg" alt="Hyperactivity symptoms image" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
            <p>Hyperactivity symptoms can be particularly challenging in situations that require quiet or stillness, such as in a classroom or during a meeting. People with ADHD may have trouble sitting still, may feel the need to constantly move, or may have trouble engaging in quiet activities.</p>
            <p>In addition, hyperactivity symptoms can also manifest in excessive talking or interrupting others, which can lead to difficulties in social and professional settings.</p>

            <h2>Impulsivity Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Interrupting others or blurting out answers</li>
                <li>Difficulty waiting for one's turn or taking turns</li>
                <li>Impatience, such as interrupting others or finishing their sentences</li>
                <li>Difficulty with self-control, such as saying something inappropriate or acting impulsively</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/imp.webp" alt="Impulsivity symptoms image" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
            <p>Impulsivity symptoms can lead to difficulties in social and professional settings, as people with ADHD may have trouble controlling their impulses or waiting for their turn. This can lead to difficulties in relationships and daily interactions.</p>
            <p>In addition, impulsivity symptoms can also manifest in reckless or risky behavior, such as substance abuse or dangerous driving.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time to time, but for people with ADHD, these symptoms are persistent and interfere with daily life.</p>
