            <h1>What is ADHD?</h1>
            <p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects both children and adults. It is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</p>
            <img src="images/brain.png" alt="ADHD brain image" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
            <p>ADHD is often misunderstood as simply being "hyper" or "distractible," but it is a complex condition that affects an individual's ability to regulate their attention, behavior, and emotions.</p>
            <img src="images/statics.webp" alt="ADHD statistics image" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
            <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 8.4% of children and 4.4% of adults in the United States have ADHD.</p>
            <p>ADHD is not caused by poor parenting, too much sugar, or a lack of discipline. Rather, it is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate executive function, working memory, and emotional control.</p>
            <p>Research suggests that ADHD is related to differences in brain structure and function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive function, planning, and impulse control. Additionally, genetic factors, environmental toxins, and nutritional deficiencies may also contribute to the development of ADHD.</p>
            <p>ADHD can affect individuals of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds. While it is often associated with children, ADHD can persist into adulthood, and many adults are diagnosed with the condition later in life.</p>
            <p>Despite its prevalence, ADHD remains widely misunderstood, and individuals with ADHD often face stigma, discrimination, and social isolation. However, with proper diagnosis, treatment, and support, individuals with ADHD can thrive and lead successful, fulfilling lives.</p>
            <p>It's essential to recognize that ADHD is not a defect or a weakness, but rather a difference in brain function that requires accommodations and support. By promoting awareness, understanding, and acceptance, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with ADHD.</p>
